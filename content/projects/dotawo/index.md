*Dotawo* offers a platform in which the old meets the new, in which archaeological, papyrological, and philological research into Meroitic, Old Nubian, Coptic, Greek, and Arabic sources confront current investigations in modern anthropology and ethnography, Nilo-Saharan linguistics, and critical and theoretical approaches present in post-colonial and African studies.

Bringing these disparate fields together within the same fold, opening a cross-cultural and diachronic field where divergent approaches meet on common soil, *Dotawo* gives a common home to the past, present, and future of one of the richest areas of research in African studies. It offers a crossroads where papyrus can meet internet, scribes meet critical thinkers, and the promises of growing nations meet the accomplishments of old kingdoms.

*Dotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies* is an open access journal and its articles can be accessed through the [eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/dotawo) platform of the University of California. Printed and PDF issues are available through open-access publisher [punctum books](https://punctumbooks.com/imprints/dotawo/). *Dotawo* is peer-reviewed and indexed in the [Database of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/toc/2373-2571).

The Dotawo Monograph series presents both unpublished material from the field of Nubian studies and original research and is published in collaboration with open-access publisher [punctum books](https://punctumbooks.com/imprints/dotawo/).
