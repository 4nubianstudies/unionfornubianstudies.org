The [Meroe Archival Project](http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/meroecity/) (MAP) re-examines Peter L. Shinnieâ€™s domestic excavations at the Royal City of Meroe in order to:

1. provide research exchanges and training between University of Reading and the University of Khartoum;
2. produce a more refined understanding of diachronic change, economic and social life at Meroe;
3. capture the memories of those who took part in these critical excavations.

MAP is supported by a [British Academy](http://www.britac.ac.uk/) International Partnership Scheme. Staff from the University of Reading, University of Khartoum, and the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) has been fundamental for the development of this project.
