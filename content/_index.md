Founded in 2016, the Union for Nubian Studies (UNS) is an academic and para-academic effort to bring together all fields of Nubian studies. UNS hopes to form a community engaging in all periods of Nubian history through all intellectual and creative disciplines. It supports projects offering cross-cultural and diachronic approaches to Nubia.

UNS offers a multidisciplinary home to the past, present and future of a region oriented around the cataracts of the Nile, one of the hotbeds of human civilization. It is a crossroads where papyrus meets open access, scribes meet critical thinkers, artifacts meet ideas and the promises of growing nations meet the accomplishments of old kingdoms.
